Site to calculate the Expected delivery date and estimated gestational age of an incoming baby
I am currently a 400L medical student at Osun State University , Nigeria. I recently entered my first obstetrics and gynecology posting and during the course of the week , we have our antenatal clinic day . Usually the medical consultants arrive to see the pregnant women to monitor the health of the mother and her foetus . And one of the imperatives is to know the expected delivery date of the baby as well as how long the foetus has been in the womb which is the gestational age . And so the consultants would ask us to make use of a manual method to calculate these parameters which was tasking and took a longer time to solve.For that reason , I built this simple site to solve this issue. It is much faster and even more accurate. I would love for you guys to check it out. Thanks.
